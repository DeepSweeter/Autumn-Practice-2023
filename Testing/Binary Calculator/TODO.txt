One scenario must check the functionality of the DUT that when we activate Sample the next posedge of Clk, StartTx is active .

One scenario must check the functionality of the DUT when reset is active, that all the internal registers and output signals have reset value.

One scenario must check the functionality of the DUT when we cross between Mode 0 and Mode 1.

One scenario must make 7 different operations and write the different 7 results to memory in mode 1 and the MEMORY_SIZE is 8, after MEMORY_SIZE should be changed to 4 and 1 result to be written.

One scenario must write the results of 8 operations in mode 1 when MEMORY_SIZE is 8, after the mode should be changed to 0, make 3 new operations, then the mode changed to 1 and read from memory from 9 different addresses.

One scenario must check what happens when the RTL is in Mode 1 write to memory, but a reset is randomly activated.

One scenario must check if, after reset, we enter in Mode 1 and we try to read something, if we can get any valid data.

One scenario must check the functionality of the DUT when we cross from Mode 1 read to Mode 1 write, if we have any errors.

One scenario must check the functionality of the DUT when we cross from a CLK frequency (ClkX is divided by 2) to a different one (ClkX is divided by 5) and we are in Mode 1 Read from memory, if we have any errors.

One scenario must check what happens if we fill the memory then empty the memory, but we keep trying to read from the memory.

One scenario must check the functionality of the DUT when we cross between INVALID INPUT_KEY and VALID INPUT_KEY.

One scenario must check the functionality of the DUT when the mode 0 is active, and a reset is activated for 3 clock cycles.
